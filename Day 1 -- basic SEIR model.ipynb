    "The research goal this week is to explore covid-19 modeling for a university campus. We will write code to simulate a **S**usceptible-**E**xposed-**I**nfectious-**R**ecovered (SEIR) model and study the sensitivty of this model to various parameters or simplifications. The SEIR model was the basis for Cornell's fall 2020 reactivation plan, which is detailed in the report listed in the readings below. \n",

    "### The SEIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEIR model is a [compartmental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology). The basic idea is that, at every step, each individual is in one of four states:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><i>Susceptible (S)</i>: able to contract the virus</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Exposed (E)</i>: already infected but cannot infect others</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Infectious (I)</i>: infected and can infect others</li>\n",
    "    <li><i>Recovered (R)</i>: healthy and no longer able to contract the virus</li>    \n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The virus propagates in steps, and we will think of each step as one day in real time. At each step, susceptible people may become exposed, exposed people may become infectious, and infectious people may infect others and/or recover. We will assue that these events happen roughly \"at once\" at the end of each day (this is simplification, but a useful one for simulations). There are many ways to model the various compartments of the SEIR model&mdash;the Cornell report is 54 pages! We will examine a few over the next few days.\n",
