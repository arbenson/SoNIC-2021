# 2021 SoNIC Workshop

This repository contains the research lab material for the 2021 Cornell [SoNIC Workshop](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/content/workshop/sonic). 

There are three research labs centered on modeling the spread of covid-19. 
The first consists of implementing and understanding the SEIR model.
The second models interventions and analyzes their effects on spreading.
The third will build more realistic extensions on the models used in the first two labs.

### Preparation

The labs are based on Jupyter notebooks and Python. Make sure that you can run and understand the notebook `basic-setup.ipynb`.
